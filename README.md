Here is the code behind my Shiny app, **Mapping Minnesota's Elections**! In this app, you can view county-level results of recent statewide elections in Minnesota, and view precinct-level results of the concurrent state legislative elections. This could be useful for election geeks interested in an all-in-one MN elections hub (so, myself). Folks working in politics could also use it to see what precincts would be especially worth canvassing.

A previous version of this app is available online! But I'm creating a new version, so the link is withheld until this new version has been posted. This repository is only for those who want to see under the hood of the app. My app primarily uses data from the MN Secretary of State's website, though data from the MN legislature's website is also used, and I scraped a couple pages on the Ballotpedia website as well. Shapefiles for the counties of Minnesota were found online. I probably should have kept a link to that source - oops. I could certainly hunt down the source if it were necessary.

The main features of this app are **maps** and **tables**. On the statewide elections tab, the user can select an office and see a Leaflet map with hover-able counties, alongside a table with each candidate's total performance. On the state senate and state house tabs, the user can choose a district and see similar products, though instead of hover-able counties, the map has hover-able precincts. If the user is only interested in metro districts, they can click a button to limit their choices to only metro districts -- and likewise for nonmetro districts. Lastly, the user can type in a city name and find out what district(s) that city is located in.
